# Data Science Portfolio

Hello! I am currently a Data Analyst that is working towards becoming a Data Scientist!

This repository will host my notebooks where I will copy over the projects I have been working on. 

[Here I used a CDC dataset from Kaggle to determine how income level effects self ratings of various health measures] (https://github.com/Tyreal676/tyreal676.github.io/blob/main/Using%20Income%20to%20Predict%20Overall%20Health).

Here is where I merged several files of Spotify data into a single database and uploaded it to a customized SQL database [https://github.com/Tyreal676/tyreal676.github.io/blob/main/For%20Streamlit.py]
